# Java Snake Game

Welcome to the Java Snake Game! This classic arcade game is implemented in Java, where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats apples to grow, and aims to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Apple Eating:** The snake can eat apples that randomly appear on the screen, increasing its length and the player's score.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.
- **High Score:** Keep track of your highest score achieved during gameplay.
